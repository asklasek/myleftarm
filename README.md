Text based survival game

You start the game with a set amount of health, and each room you enter decreases that health!
The rooms will randomly generate items, npcs, monsters, and interactable furniture.
The game is driven by decisions you make from the items you aquire through your journey.
All interactions have a good and bad outcome, even saving people from monsters.

Enjoy the game!
